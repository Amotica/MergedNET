# Minimum dependencies required to use these codes:
Python 3.6.1

Keras 2.0.6

Tensorflow 1.3.0

Numpy 1.13.3

Pillow 5.1.0

Opencv 3.2.0

# Running the codes:
Use train.py to train the baseline models and train_lite.py can be used to train the "Lite" models

Use evaluate.py to evaluate the baseline models and evaluate_lite.py to evaluate the "Lite" models.

Most network parameters can be changed in the parameter file.

All CNN models are contained in the Models folder

Dataset not included but can be downloaded from http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/17/index.html
